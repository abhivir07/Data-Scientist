    "- With the **modern computing model (Machine Learning)** this paradigm is changes. \n",
    "    - We feed the algorithms (models) with data.\n",

    "- **Get Data**: Identify relevant data for the problem you want to solve. This data set should represent the type of data that the Machine Learn model will use to predict from in Phase 2 (predction).\n",
    "- **Pre-processing**: This step is about cleaning up data. While the Machine Learning is awesome, it cannot figure out what good data looks like. You need to do the cleaning as well as transforming data into a desired format.\n",
    "- **Train model**: This is where the magic happens, the learning step (Train model). There are three main paradigms in machine learning.\n",
    "    - **Supervised**: where you tell the algorithm what categories each data item is in. Each data item from the training set is tagged with the right answer.\n",
    "    - **Unsupervised**: is when the learning algorithm is not told what to do with it and it should make the structure itself.\n",
    "    - **Reinforcement**: teaches the machine to think for itself based on past action rewards.\n",
    "- **Test model**: Finally, the testing is done to see if the model is good. The training data was divided into a test set and training set. The test set is used to see if the model can predict from it. If not, a new model might be necessary.\n",
