# Decorators!!
# Decorators are an extremely powerful concept in Python. They allow you to modify the behavior of a function without changing the code of the function itself. This chapter will lay the foundational concepts needed to thoroughly understand decorators (functions as objects, scope, and closures), and give you a good introduction into how decorators are used and defined. This deep dive into Python internals will set you up to be a superstar Pythonista.

# Building a command line data app
# You are building a command line tool that lets a user interactively explore a data set. We've defined four functions: mean(), std(), minimum(), and maximum() that users can call to analyze their data. Help finish this section of the code so that your users can call any of these functions by typing the function name at the input prompt.

# Note: The function get_user_input() in this exercise is a mock version of asking the user to enter a command. It randomly returns one of the four function names. In real life, you would ask for input and wait until the user entered a value.

# Add the missing function references to the function map
function_map = {
  'mean': mean,
  'std': std,
  'minimum': minimum,
  'maximum': maximum
}

data = load_data()
print(data)

func_name = get_user_input()

# Call the chosen function and pass "data" as an argument
function_map[func_name](data)


# Returning functions for a math game
# You are building an educational math game where the player enters a math term, and your program returns a function that matches that term. For instance, if the user types "add", your program returns a function that adds two numbers. So far you've only implemented the "add" function. Now you want to include a "subtract" function.


def create_math_function(func_name):
  if func_name == 'add':
    def add(a, b):
      return a + b
    return add
  elif func_name == 'subtract':
    # Define the subtract() function
    def subtract(a,b):
      return a - b
    return subtract
  else:
    print("I don't know that one")
    
add = create_math_function('add')
print('5 + 2 = {}'.format(add(5, 2)))

subtract = create_math_function('subtract')
print('5 - 2 = {}'.format(subtract(5, 2)))



# Modifying variables outside local scope
# Sometimes your functions will need to modify a variable that is outside of the local scope of that function. While it's generally not best practice to do so, it's still good to know-how in case you need to do it. Update these functions so they can modify variables that would usually be outside of their scope.


call_count = 0

def my_function():
  # Use a keyword that lets us update call_count 
  global call_count
  call_count += 1
  
  print("You've called my_function() {} times!".format(
    call_count
  ))
  
for _ in range(20):
  my_function()



#   Checking for closure
# You're teaching your niece how to program in Python, and she is working on returning nested functions. She thinks she has written the code correctly, but she is worried that the returned function won't have the necessary information when called. Show her that all of the nonlocal variables she needs are in the new function's closure.

def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

# Show that my_func()'s closure is not None
print(my_func.____ is not None)



# Closures keep your values safe
# You are still helping your niece understand closures. You have written the function get_new_func() that returns a nested function. The nested function call_func() calls whatever function was passed to get_new_func(). You've also written my_special_function() which simply prints a message that states that you are executing my_special_function().

# You want to show your niece that no matter what you do to my_special_function() after passing it to get_new_func(), the new function still mimics the behavior of the original my_special_function() because it is in the new function's closure.

def my_special_function():
  print('You are running my_special_function()')
  
def get_new_func(func):
  def call_func():
    func()
  return call_func

new_func = get_new_func(my_special_function)

# Redefine my_special_function() to just print "hello"
def my_special_function():
  ____

new_func()



# Using decorator syntax
# You have written a decorator called print_args that prints out all of the arguments and their values any time a function that it is decorating gets called.


def my_function(a, b, c):
  print(a + b + c)

# Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator
my_function = print_args(my_function)

my_function(1, 2, 3)



# Defining a decorator
# Your buddy has been working on a decorator that prints a "before" message before the decorated function is called and prints an "after" message after the decorated function is called. They are having trouble remembering how wrapping the decorated function is supposed to work. Help them out by finishing their print_before_and_after() decorator.

def print_before_and_after(func):
  def wrapper(*args):
    print('Before {}'.format(func.__name__))
    # Call the function being decorated with *args
    func(*args)
    print('After {}'.format(func.__name__))
  # Return the nested function
  return wrapper

@print_before_and_after
def multiply(a, b):
  print(a * b)

multiply(5, 10)
